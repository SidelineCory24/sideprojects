## Overview
This script removes the hassle of having to login to twitter daily to tweet the same tweets.

The daily tweets are stored in a dictonary and are tweeted out every few minutes.

The sleep timer on **Line 56** can be changed to whatever time suits you best.
`time.sleep(480)`

This script also enables the ability to do adhoc tweets as well.

You will need to have a Twitter account to access the Twitter API.
